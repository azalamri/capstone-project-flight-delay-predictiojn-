# Predicting Flights Delays Using MachineÂ Learning

This project was done in an attempt to tackle flights delays using machine learning you can find a detailed explanation on a medium post [here](https://medium.com/@azalamri3/predicting-flights-delays-using-machine-learning-bfe24999dee4)
 
## Installations

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:
* Pandas
*  NumPy 
* scikit-learn
* seaborn
* matplotlib.pyplot




## Summary
In this project, I've tried regression to predict delay time and Classification to determine the flight status to be on time or will be delayed. 

## Conclusion 
The classification approach gave me a better results!
